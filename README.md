biblatex-ext - Extended biblatex standard styles
================================================

The `biblatex-ext` bundle provides styles that slightly extend the
standard styles that ship with `biblatex`. The styles offered in this
bundle provide a simple interface to change some of the stylistic
decisions made in the standard styles. At the same time they stay as
close to their standard counterparts as possible, so that most
customisation methods can be applied here as well.

The main motivation was to offer `biblatex` styles that place the
editor of `@incollection` works before the `booktitle`, yet remain
close to the standard styles in overall look and feel and
customisability. The code adjustments required for this are not 
particularly complicated once you get the hang of it, but a stable and
clean solution requires a rewrite of the bibliography driver, easily
amassing hundred lines of code in the preamble. Some contributed styles
already place the editor before the `booktitle` (`biblatex-apa` comes
to mind), but you may not want to buy into all the other changes that
come with choosing one of them. Styles written for the sole purpose of
following a particular style guide are not always easily modified and
may have to go to great lengths to implement the requirements of the
style guide. The styles of this bundle are intended to be a solid base
for further customisations.

`biblatex-ext` has an extended version `ext-<style>` for each of
`biblatex`'s standard styles. The bundle consists of the following

distribution and not manually. See the documentation for more
installation instructions.
