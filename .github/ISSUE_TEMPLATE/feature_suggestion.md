This is just a convenient template for a feature suggestion to make it easier for you to check that all the necessary information is included.
Please don't feel intimidated by this template (I know I always feel a bit weird when I encounter these templates).
Feel free to change the structure suggested below as you see fit or to discard it completely if you don't feel comfortable using it.
--->

**Describe the problem**
A short description of the problem you are trying to solve with the suggestion.

**Describe the desired outcome**
A short description of the desired outcome.

**Describe the suggestion**
An explanation of the suggestion.

**Additional information**
If possible, please include a short example document that can be used to illustrate and test ideas.
Even if there is 'nothing to see at the moment' it is very helpful to have something to start from and test ideas with.

As always, please make sure that the example is relevant and includes as little code as possible.
You can use the example `.bib` file [`biblatex-examples.bib`](https://github.com/plk/biblatex/blob/master/bibtex/bib/biblatex/biblatex-examples.bib) that comes as part of a `biblatex` installation if you need a few example bibliography items. If you want to use your own entries, please include the relevant `.bib` items as well. An elegant way to do that is the `filecontents` environment, but if you don't feel comfortable using that you can just paste the entries separately. Please avoid references to files, packages and classes that are not on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/) and remove unnecessary `\input` and `\include` statements.
